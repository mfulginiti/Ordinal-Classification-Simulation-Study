# Ordinal-Classification-Simulation-Study
Ordinal classification simulation study using sample generation by replacement (SGR, Lombardi and Pastore 2014).  

A study to determine how various data falsification scenarios effect misclassification rates in binary logistic regression modelling. 

This simulation study was performed entirely using R.  The RMarkdown document can be opened in RStudio and run independently.  Necessary packages are tidyverse and sgr.  The xtable package was used to create the tables.  Note that it may take several hours to knit the program as is.  When including the additional code in the appendix, it may take up to several days to complete.
